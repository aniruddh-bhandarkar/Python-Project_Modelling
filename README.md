# Python Project 2021-2022

Description

<p>
In this project the objective is to visualize Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM). SHM is a phenomenon in physics that has repetitive motion with same frequency across an equilibrium position and the displacement of the moving object on either side of equilibrium is the same. 
</p>
<p>
To study SHM 2 common phenomenon in physics are traced using Python:
Swinging pendulum of varying lengths and mass of the bob attached to the pendulum
Spring with a mass tied to the end performing a Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
For each of the phenomenon the variables in the equation are changed and then impact is observed in the simulation. The dimensions of the physical object and length of objects are varied to determine if there is any change in SHM.

The 2 phenomena are then independently plotted as a wave on XY axis demonstrating the variation in the independent dimension along x axis of time while plotting the variation in the amplitude and frequency along the Y axis.
</p>

To simulate the phenomena in Python the following packages:

 -NumPy to perform data computation
  
 -matplotlib to plot the function 
  
 -VPython to plot the simulation
